CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:17 (target_link_libraries):
  Policy CMP0023 is not set: Plain and keyword target_link_libraries
  signatures cannot be mixed.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0023" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  The plain signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "chat".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a target should
  be either all-keyword or all-plain.

  The uses of the plain signature are here:

   * CMakeLists.txt:16 (target_link_libraries)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

  The keyword signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with

  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
  information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
